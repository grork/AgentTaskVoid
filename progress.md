# Plan Execution Progress

Serial execution of `plan/` phases via Sonnet 5 (max-thinking) subagents.
Each phase: an **executor** subagent implements it, then an independent **reviewer**
subagent — handed the phase file directly, not the executor's summary — signs off only
if (a) all tests pass and (b) the code satisfies **every** acceptance criterion in the
phase file. On review failure, a fresh executor retries with the reviewer's objections;
a phase that fails review **twice** halts the whole run for operator attention.

- Branch: `plan-execution`
- Started: 2026-07-07
- Only advance to the next phase after sign-off.
- **Commit convention:** phases 01–04 committed together as `f706cf4` (they were built as one intermingled snapshot). From phase 05 onward, **one commit per phase, made immediately after reviewer sign-off** (message `Phase NN: <title>`, Co-Authored-By trailer). Branch `plan-execution`; no pushing unless asked.
- **Subagent thinking level:** phases 01–03 ran at max (ultrathink). From **phase 04 onward: Sonnet + xhigh** (operator request 2026-07-08, to keep token usage on track).

## Detail log

### Phase 01 — Foundation ✅ (signed off 1st attempt)
- **Files:** created `Directory.Build.props`, `build/Atv.Package.targets`, `version.json`, `src/Atv/{Atv.csproj,Branding.cs,Program.cs}`, `src/Atv/Package/AppxManifest.template.xml`, `src/Atv/Package/Public/.gitkeep`, `src/Atv/Properties/launchSettings.json`; moved logos to `src/Atv/Package/Assets/`; rewrote `CLAUDE.md`/`README.md`/`AppTaskInfoCli.slnx`; deleted `AppTaskInfoCli.csproj`, root `Program.cs`, `Register-Identity.ps1`, `Unregister-Identity.ps1`, `app.manifest`, `identity/`.
- **Result:** clean build; package identity `Agentaskvoid-bbbb1168_0.1.0.39392_arm64` via winapp dev loop; manifest stamped under `obj/` only w/ WriteOnlyWhenDifferent; AOT publish 2.64 MB (arm64 2.76 MB), zero warnings; create/list/clear round-trips on Debug + Release AOT.
- **Review:** PASS. AC1–AC6 independently reproduced. Invariants #2 (single brand source) and #3 (no hardcoded PFN) upheld. Residual: taskbar-render is visual-only (not agent-observable); win-x64 API activation inconclusive under arm64 emulation → native arm64 round-trip substituted.
- **Note for later phases:** `AppxManifest.template.xml` display strings are hand-typed brand literals (settled per DIST-7) — a rebrand touches both `Branding.cs` and the template.

### Phase 02 — Core seam ✅ (signed off 1st attempt)
- **Files:** created `src/Atv/Store/{IAppTaskStore.cs,AppTaskView.cs,AppTaskStore.cs}`; `tests/Atv.LogicTests/` (csproj + `MSTestSettings.cs` + `Store/{FakeAppTaskStore.cs,FakeAppTaskStoreTests.cs}` + `Architecture/SeamPurityTests.cs`); `docs/testing/fake-fidelity-promises.md`. Modified `src/Atv/Program.cs` (routed onto the seam) and `AppTaskInfoCli.slnx`.
- **Result:** 16/16 logic tests green (MSTest+MTP, `EnableMSTestRunner`); `AppTaskStore.cs` is the sole importer of `Windows.UI.Shell.Tasks`, enforced by a non-vacuous `SeamPurityTests`; DTO content model faithful to the documented API; AOT publish clean (~2.79 MB); suite runs with no identity/API.
- **Review:** PASS. AC1–AC5 independently reproduced; invariants #7 (single importer) and #8 (fidelity promises single source) upheld.
- **Deferred notes from review (non-blocking):** (a) `SeamPurityTests` only walks `src/Atv/**`, not `tests/**` — widen if test-side WinRT usage ever becomes plausible. (b) Fixed at orchestration: stale "no test project exists yet" line in `CLAUDE.md`.

### Phase 03 — Real-API adapter harness ✅ (signed off 1st attempt)
- **Files:** created `tests/Atv.AdapterTests/*` (MTP exe: `IdentityGate.cs`, `TasksJsonReader.cs`, `AdapterFidelityTests.cs`, `PeriodicClobberTests.cs`, `AssemblySetup.cs`, `MSTestSettings.cs`, `Package/AppxManifest.template.xml`), `build/Atv.TestIdentity.targets`, `tools/Atv.TestIdentityTool/*` (subprocess `PackageManager` helper), `global.json` (routes `dotnet test` through native MTP). Modified `AppTaskInfoCli.slnx`, `docs/windows-ui-shell-tasks/README.md`.
- **Key discovery:** a directly-launched exe does NOT carry package identity → uses the plan-permitted AppExecutionAlias fallback via a hard-link to the alias stub. Test identity pool = `Agentaskvoid.Test.<worktree-hash>` (isolated from dev/release). Registration is external (MSBuild `_MTPBuild`/`_TestRunStart` hook → subprocess tool); in-test gate only asserts, SKIPs when identity absent.
- **Result:** adapter suite single-pass green (17 pass / 1 periodic skip), serial; clears tasks before+after; unregister/sweep external and not required; API-absent → skip+exit0; periodic 4×100 clobber gated off by default (manual run: ~67/400 survive → confirms last-writer-wins).
- **Review:** PASS. All 7 ACs met. Deviations assessed OK: `global.json` (no regression — logic suite still 16/16, AOT clean), `--ignore-exit-code 8` (verified doesn't mask failures — broken assert still exits 2), hardlink identity mechanism (sound, gate never registers in-proc). Residuals: full concurrent-worktree run (formula proven), sweep actual-reap path (code-reviewed, blocked from live exercise). Executor's "CLAUDE.md is stale" claim was mistaken; fixed the one real stale line at orchestration.

### Phase 04 — Persistence ✅ (signed off 1st attempt; executor completed inline by orchestrator)
- **Execution note:** the executor subagent hit a session-token limit after writing all source + test files but before verifying. Orchestrator finished the verification pass inline: fixed 2 compile errors (`ReconcilerTests` missing `using Atv.Store`; `Assert.ThrowsException`→`Assert.Throws` ×2 for MSTest 4.x) and one **real concurrency bug** (`SidecarStore.Write` atomic rename threw `UnauthorizedAccessException` when a lock-free reader held the destination open → added bounded `ReplaceAtomically` retry, 100×2ms, preserves atomicity); cleaned 6 MSTEST0037 style warnings. Independent reviewer still ran as a separate subagent.
- **Files:** created `src/Atv/Persistence/{WriteGate,SidecarStore,SidecarEntry,Reconciler,RecycleBin,AppPaths,HandleEncoding,PersistenceJsonContext}.cs`; `tests/Atv.LogicTests/Persistence/{WriteGateTests,SidecarStoreTests,ReconcilerTests,RecycleBinTests,HandleEncodingTests,AppPathsTests,CountingAppTaskStore,TempDirectory}.cs`.
- **Result:** solution builds 0 warn/0 err; logic suite 69/69 green (incl. phase-02's 16); src AOT publish clean (~2.92 MB). WriteGate takes a raw `System.Threading.Mutex` (no abstraction), holds it across the whole critical section, handles AbandonedMutex; sidecar = reversible percent-encoded per-handle files, atomic temp+rename, wall-clock `lastUpdate` every write; reconciler 4 rules + structural no-FindAll/no-sweep proof via `CountingAppTaskStore`; recycle bin TTL round-trip + scavenge + hot-path-never-enumerates proof.
- **Review:** PASS. AC1–AC5 met; invariants #2/#3/#5/#6 verified by grep + code read; SidecarStore retry fix assessed sound.
- **Note for phases 05/09:** `RecycleBin.Tombstone` uses temp+rename WITHOUT the SidecarStore retry — OK under its current "all members run inside WriteGate" contract, but if a lock-free recycle-bin reader is ever added, guard it the same way.

### Phase 05 — Task operations ✅ (signed off 1st attempt)
- **Files:** created `src/Atv/Operations/{SafeCombinationMatrix,Validator,AdvanceModel,Resurrection,TaskOperations}.cs`; `tests/Atv.LogicTests/Operations/*` (11 files: harness + matrix/validator/advance + per-verb start/step/state/done-fail-attention/resurrection/concurrency/remove).
- **Result:** 132/132 logic tests green (63 new + 69 prior); build 0/0; AOT clean. Matrix = 7 safe cells as data in `SafeCombinationMatrix.cs` (independently cross-checked vs `state-content-compatibility.md`). Each verb: WriteGate(once) → reconcile → miss-path recycle check → validate → store write → sidecar stamp. FIFO cap 10; step preserves+re-sends read state; resurrection within TTL restores core info + fresh steps.
- **Review:** PASS. AC1–AC7 met; invariants #1/#4/#5/#6/#8 upheld; no scope creep (returns structured outcomes, no arg-parse/exit-code/icon-render).
- **Deviation RATIFIED by operator (2026-07-08):** `start` on a *never-seen* handle **creates** (not a no-op). Operator chose "ratify + tidy docs" → amended `plan/phase-05-task-operations.md` (resurrection bullet + AC6) and `questions/usage-ergonomics/ERGO-25-*.md` (recycle-bin caveat) so the records match the shipped code: (a) never-seen no-op applies only to the five update-class verbs; `start` creates; (b) a resurrecting `start` uses the caller's fields (not the tombstone's), fresh steps. Included in the phase-05 doc-tidy commit.

### Phase 06 — Config, output contract, durable log ✅ (signed off 1st attempt; lean mode)
- **Files:** created `src/Atv/Config/{Settings,SettingsLoader,SettingsJsonContext}.cs`, `src/Atv/Diagnostics/{FailureLog,Posture,Output}.cs`; tests `tests/Atv.LogicTests/{Config,Diagnostics}/*` (6 files).
- **Result:** 206/206 logic tests green (74 new); build 0/0; AOT clean. Precedence flag>env>file>default (STJ source-gen, flat string→string map); brand-derived env names; non-disruptive posture (exit0 + always-logged failure) w/ `--strict` exit vocab 1/2/3/4 + `--json` `{ok,reason}`; durable log w/ size+age rotation, swallows write failures; INFRA-13 capability→exit(2/3) mapping folded into `Posture`.
- **Review:** PASS. AC1–AC5 met; invariants #1/#2/#4 upheld; scope held (no doctor/watchdog/run wiring). Deviations all ACCEPTABLE: `--json`+`--strict`→strict exit wins; some JSON contexts folded into DTO files; `MutexWaitBudget`=`WriteGate.DefaultTimeout`.
- **Notes for phase 08 (composition root):** (a) wire `SettingsLoader`'s `Warnings` seam into `FailureLog` at startup (loader deliberately has no Diagnostics dep); (b) add a `--json`+`--strict` combination test (currently untested, non-blocking).
